## 🗃️ Suggested Repo Structure (Monorepo)

You can host all five apps in one GitHub repo like:

react-hands-on-labs/
├── officespacerentalapp/
├── eventexamplesapp/
├── ticketbookingapp/
├── bloggerapp/
├── cricketapp/
└── README.md



Or create **one repo per project** if submitting individually.

---

## ✅ Final Tips

- Check image paths — use `/public/` for all images
- Include screenshots in README (optional)
- `npm install` first before running `npm start`
- Push to GitHub with `.gitignore` enabled

---

Want me to:
- Create one complete sample `README.md` from your final `cricketapp`?
- Help you deploy one app live on GitHub or Vercel?

Let me know!
